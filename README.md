How to set up this environment to run the notebook
1. Download the Anaconda Distribution
2. Create a new environment, and conda install all the imports. Here is a more informative tutorial: https://www.codecademy.com/article/setup-deep-learning-environment
3. Download JupyterLab as well in this environment. I decided to use JupyterLab instead of JupyterNotebook because apparently it's much easier to set up a GPU to run with the code in JupyterLab instead of JupyterNotebook
4. (If you want to regenerate new music) Click Restart Kernal and Run all Cells (It's the double forward arrow symbol)
5. Output the data
